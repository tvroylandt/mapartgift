# Create map as a gift

The goal of mapartgift is to help create beautiful maps from OpenStreetMaps layers for your colleagues and family.

It is deeply inspired (almost forked) from https://taraskaduk.com/2019/12/20/print-maps/ and https://erdavis.com/2019/07/27/the-beautiful-hidden-logic-of-cities/ 

## Installation

You can install the package with 

``` r
devtools::install_github("tvroylandt/mapartgift")
```
## Package

The package contains two functions :

+ one to load the data ;
+ one to plot the map.

```{r example}
# library(mapartgift)
```
