# Create map as a gift

The goal of mapartgift is to help create beautiful maps from
OpenStreetMaps layers for your colleagues and family.

It is deeply inspired (almost forked) from
<https://taraskaduk.com/2019/12/20/print-maps/> and
<https://erdavis.com/2019/07/27/the-beautiful-hidden-logic-of-cities/>

## Installation

You can install the package with

``` r
devtools::install_github("tvroylandt/mapartgift")
```

## Package

The package contains two functions :

  - one to load the data ;
  - one to plot the map.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
# library(mapartgift)
```
